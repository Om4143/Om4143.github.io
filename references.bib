abstract = {We extend our previous investigations on intermittency using the Scaled Factorial Moment (SFM) technique in Au + Au collisions within the FAIR energy range of 2–12A GeV (Elab, i.e., laboratory frame energy per nucleon). We focus on the fluctuations in the number of protons, motivated by QCD-inspired model predictions that link critical behavior to the net baryon density fluctuations. Employing a hybrid version of the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) event generator, we analyze the intermittency across pseudorapidity χ(η) and azimuthal χ(ϕ) spaces. Utilizing Chiral + HG equation of state, we explore the distinct intermittent emission patterns and their dependence on incident beam energy. We observe that the strength of intermittency decreases with increasing beam energy. These results highlight the significance of investigating proton fluctuations as a key approach to understand the critical dynamics of QCD phase transitions and provide insights into the evolution of matter in high-energy collisions.}
