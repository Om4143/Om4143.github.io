## Abstract

In this paper, we present comprehensive results on intermittency using the Scaled Factorial Moment (SFM) technique in Au + Au collisions in the FAIR energy range of 2–12A GeV in pseudorapidity 
, azimuthal, and pseudorapidity-azimuthal spaces. The simulations are performed with a hybrid version of the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) event generator. Three alternative equations of state (EoS) are employed to investigate the intermittency within the hydrodynamic scenario, namely pure Hadron Gas (HG), Chiral + HG, and Bag Model EoS. In both one and two-dimensional spaces and at all beam energies, a weak intermittent type of emission has been seen for Chiral+HG EoS. In contrast, a strong intermittent kind of emission is observed for Bag Model EoS. The incident beam energy dependency of intermittency has also been investigated. The strength of the intermittency is seen to diminish with increasing beam energy.
