### Profile

I am a researcher and scientific software engineer with 8+ years of experience working with
large-scale scientific data, detector simulations, and reproducible analysis pipelines.

I specialize in transforming complex datasets into **reliable, actionable insights** through
well-engineered workflows, developed within international collaborations such as **CBM/FAIR,
GSI Helmholtz Centre**, and **Goethe University Frankfurt**.


### Research & Data Analytics Expertise

- Data analysis, exploratory statistics, and modeling using **Python** (pandas, NumPy, SciPy) and ROOT  
- Querying and analyzing structured datasets using **SQL**  
- Data cleaning, transformation, and validation across heterogeneous data sources  
- Scientific software development in **C++ and Python**  
- Reproducible workflows, **CMake-based builds**, CI/CD, and automated testing  
- Data visualization and reporting for clear technical and non-technical communication


### What I Work On

- Designing reliable data analysis pipelines for large and complex datasets  
- Validating simulations and experimental data through statistical analysis  
- Building maintainable scientific software used by distributed research teams  
- Applying physics-informed data analysis techniques to real-world problems

**Tech stack:** Python · SQL · C++ · Git · Linux · ROOT · CMake · CI/CD

### Get Started
