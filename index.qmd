:::{#hero-heading}



I am a researcher and scientific software engineer with over eight years of experience in **high-energy nuclear physics**, **detector simulation**, and **data-driven scientific computing**. My work focuses on developing robust, reproducible software pipelines for large-scale simulations and physics analysis within international collaborations, including **CBM/FAIR**, **GSI Helmholtz Centre**, and **Goethe University Frankfurt**.

### Research & Technical Expertise

- Scientific software development in **C++ and Python**  
- Detector simulation, geometry modeling, and performance validation (ROOT, CBM software stack)  
- Data analysis and statistical studies in relativistic heavy-ion collisions  
- Reproducible workflows, **CMake-based builds**, CI/CD, and automated validation  
- Collaborative research software development in multi-institution environments

### Current Research Interests

- Simulation and validation of detector geometries for FAIR experiments  
- Intermittency and fluctuation analysis in heavy-ion collisions  
- High-performance and maintainable scientific software infrastructures

### Selected Links

- **Curriculum Vitae:** [PDF](files/Curriculum_Vitae_OSingh.pdf)  
- **Publications:** [Complete list](publications.qmd) | [Selected papers](posts.qmd#category=paper)
