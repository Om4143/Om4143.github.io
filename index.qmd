:::{#hero-heading}



I am a researcher and scientific software engineer with over eight years of experience in
**high-energy nuclear physics**, **detector simulation**, and **data-driven computing**.
My work focuses on transforming complex, large-scale scientific data into **reliable,
actionable insights** using reproducible and well-engineered analysis pipelines.

Alongside academic research, I bring strong **data analytics skills**,
including statistical modeling, exploratory data analysis, and automation of end-to-end
workflows. I have extensive experience working in international, cross-functional teams
within collaborations such as **CBM/FAIR**, **GSI Helmholtz Centre**, and
**Goethe University Frankfurt**.

### Research & Data Analytics Expertise

- Scientific software development in **C++ and Python**  
- Detector simulation, geometry modeling, and performance evaluation  
- Reproducible workflows, **CMake-based builds**, CI/CD, and automated testing 
- Data analysis and exploratory statistics using **Python** (pandas, NumPy, SciPy) and ROOT  
- Querying and analyzing relational datasets using **SQL**  
- Data cleaning, transformation, and validation across multiple data sources  
- Data visualization and reporting to communicate trends and results clearly
 

### Current Research & Applied Interests

- Exploratory data analysis and statistical pattern identification in complex datasets  
- Simulation-driven validation and performance optimization  
- Scalable, maintainable data analysis pipelines for research and industry  
- Applying quantitative and data-driven approaches to real-world analytical problems
