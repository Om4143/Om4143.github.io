:::{#hero-heading}
Software Developer and Data Analyst with 8+ years of experience in scientific software
engineering, data analysis, and high-performance computing. Strong background in Python
and C++, building maintainable tools, automated QA/validation, CI/CD workflows, and
data pipelines. Experienced in international teams and research-industry style environments
in Germany (Goethe University Frankfurt, GSI/FAIR). 

## Experience

Postdoctoral Researcher (Software & Data Systems), Goethe University Frankfurt,
Frankfurt am Main, Germany
– Designed and implemented a Quality Assurance (QA) framework for simulation and experimental datasets, enabling automated validation and trend monitoring across detector systems.
– Integrated automated checks into CI pipelines, improving reliability, regression detection, and
reproducibility.
– Developed a CAD → GDML → ROOT pipeline to ingest complex geometry models into
simulation workflows.
– Improved runtime and scalability by creating simplified geometry models (primitive solids)
while preserving key material/physics properties.
– Built analysis tools to compare datasets, visualize results, and support collaboration-wide data
quality decisions

## Education

- PhD, Univerisity
